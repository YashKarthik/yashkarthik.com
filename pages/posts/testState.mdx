The EVM behaves like a math function - given an input, it produces a deterministic output. The EVM takes in the current state, applies some transactions on it; and outputs the next valid state - * a state transition function *.

The definite rules for changing state from block to block are defined in the EVM.


Each transition modifies only some parts of the world state - account states with transactions executed on them.

There is a lot to transactions that I didn’t cover, but it’s about how transactions are executed and confirmed, and does not relate to state transitions.

## State change within an Account

> An account is a mapping between an address and the account state.

The account state consists of four fields: `nonce, balance, codeHash, storageRoot.`

**Nonce:** the number of txs sent from the account. It prevents a tx from being processed more than once. For a contract account it represents the number of contracts it has created.

- A transaction, by a human owned account, changes the nonce and balance in the account state.
- A tx, by a contract account, also changes the `storageRoot` (storage hash) in the account state.
