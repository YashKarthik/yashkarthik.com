I remember when 2022 started and I had a list of things I wanted to learn. Looking back I can see that I made some progress but also fell short in a few areas. In 2023 I want to be more specific and focused in my learning goals (also, I'm announcing them publicly so I feel more accountable).

So what _am_ I gonna learnt?

# Ethereum Stack
I have a decent understanding of the different parts of Ethereum development–Solidity, JS libraries etc–but never built a full-fledged project that covers the entire stack. This year, I'm planning to do [Speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) to understand building Dapps.

## Solidity
It's JS-like syntax is deceptive and now I know there's a lot for me to learn. I'm gonna dive into this by building Dapps and doing Solidity CTFs. I really enjoyed OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges and looking for more.

# Non-crypto Software
## Languages
I started with Scratch, then Python and now almost every project I build is in Typescript. I love TS, but... I feel like learning a new language. I'm split between Go and Rust. I'm probably gonna start with Go and delve into lower level languages later on when I'm exploring hardware projects.

## Miscellaneous
- I really need to understand auth. Theo's video on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wBYWWdyYQ) is really good, but I never got around to implementing it in my apps.
- AI seems to be the rage right now. While I'm not diving _deep_ into it, I'll probably build more SaaS-like projects that use AI apis. Recently: [Skimmr](https://skimmr.xyz).

# Hardware
I've explored hardware in the past, that's how I got into coding/tech, but haven't done much since the pandemic hit. Last summer I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and built an automated door handle for my room with it. And recently I won an [Orpheus Leep](https://leap-site.hackclub.dev/)(similar to Arduino) in the [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com/) hackathon. Haven't done much research into this space, but I think I'll start from the basics with C and Orpheus Leep and see where it takes me.

# Writing
I discovered my interest in writing after writing a Twitter thread.

This year, I plan to write more code-explanations and "How it Works" of open-source apps, particularly crypto protocols. I want to continue writing about my other interests and learnings from them. I'm also interested in trying out short stories.

---

Feels good declaring all this publicly. I'm excited to see where 2023 takes me.
