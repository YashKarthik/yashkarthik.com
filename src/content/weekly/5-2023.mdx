This week, I've been focused on my open source projects, particularly on improving the performance and fixing bugs. Here's what I've been working on:

Project A: I've been working on optimizing the database queries and reducing the loading time of the web page by 20%.
Project B: I've fixed a few bugs related to the authentication system and added some new features to make the user experience better.

In my free time, I've been learning about Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This week, I participated in a Solidity CTF (Capture the Flag) competition and learned a lot about smart contract security.
