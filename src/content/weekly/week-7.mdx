Farcaster's NFT tab on profiles is a really touch. It's pretty basic now, but with a little more
sorting(?) and filtering features, it could be really nice. This could be a pretty sweet browser
extension for Twitter. Twitter already has tabs for "media" and "likes"; using a content script, I
could add a tab for NFTs too. Here's what I had in mind: user goes to `twitter.com/:user`, the
extension takes the username from the url and reverse-queries it with the ENS text-records => I get
the ETH address of user, now I can pull the NFTs owned by the user. Turns out, there's no way to query ENS based on text-record, so now I'm trying to build an indexer
for ENS. I even have a good name for it: Enscan.


I explored Go this week. It's a pretty simple language. Its type system is not as good as
TypeScript, then again I haven't really explored TS's deeply, just enough to get my work done. Go's
coroutines and channels are really cool.

I haven't written Solidity that much this week. I can't make progress on Damn Vulnerable Defi
without understanding Gnosis smart contracts.
