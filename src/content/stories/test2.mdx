The world was a bleak and desperate place. The government had long since crumbled, and corporations ruled the world with an iron fist. You had grown tired of this life and longed for a better time, a time before the collapse. So, you took a chance and ordered a time machine on eBay.

Six days ago, the package arrived, and you eagerly opened it. You followed the instructions, and soon the machine was assembled and ready for use. You stepped inside and set the date for the year 2050, before the collapse. You hit the go button, and suddenly, you were transported back in time.

You stepped out of the machine into a world that was vastly different from the one you had left. The streets were filled with people, and the air was clean. You felt a sense of hope and excitement, but it was short-lived.

As you walked down the street, you realized that you were not the only one who had been transported back in time. The corporations had gotten their hands on time machines, too, and they were using them to change the course of history. They had already taken control and were working to ensure that the collapse would happen no matter what.

You were faced with a choice, fight against the corporations and try to prevent the collapse or let it happen and return to your own time. But you couldn't live with the thought of returning to a world that was even worse than the one you had left.

You took up arms and joined the resistance, fighting against the corporations in a desperate bid to change the course of history. The battles were brutal, and many lives were lost, but in the end, you and the resistance were successful.

You returned to your own time, but it was a vastly different world. The streets were once again filled with people, and the air was clean. The corporations no longer ruled the world, and the government had been restored. You had changed the course of history, and the world was a better place because of it.
