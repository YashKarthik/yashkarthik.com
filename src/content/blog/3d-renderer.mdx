I truly believe that the two best ways to learn _something_ are by doing/using that _thing_ or by
building that _thing_. I was literally just scrolling twitter before bed one sunday night and I saw some game devs
arguing about something. I don't even remember what they were arguing about, but that day I realized
I had never done anything with computer graphics. In my mind it was one of those "hard tech" domains of
software; grouped in with operating systems, kernels and stuff. And I was also on the lookout for
something exciting I could do with C++. I had learned C over the summer and the programming course
in uni was in C++. So I figured why not go all-in and just build a 3d renderer! This post contains
notes and stuff I learnt while building the rasterizer.

It's a lot of unfiltered thought and some of the math may be _formally wrong_ (beware!) but I've
tried to leave some intuitive explanation so that I myself could implement it in code.

### Drawing Straight lines
- Finally I used y = mx + c

### Filling in triangles

- Drawing a lot of lines together, makes it look like a filled in solid.
- But very inefficient.

- Barycentric coordinates are superb to test whether a point is inside or outside a triangle.
- Bounding boxes are like the rough draft we draw before drawing the actual shape.
- After drawing bounding box, we can quickly test for each point.
- For some reason, this is quicker than the line technique.

- Barycentric coordinates are also very convinient for _interpolating_ values inside the triangle.
- They are basically weighted average of the cartesian coordinates. If you have the value of
_something_ in the vertices, the weighted average of that _something_ is the value of that thing at
the location given by the Barycentric coordinates.

### Hidden face removal.

- No need to draw faces that will be hidden:
	- Efficiency.
	- Sometimes, by mistake, we might draw the hidden face over the actual face (depending on the order of faces in the file).
- So we need a way to determine if the said face (well pixel actually) is gonna be visible over the others.
	- It's hard to determine per faces, because some faces might overlap at multiple places.
	- So F1 might be above F2 for (x, y) and below F2 for some other (x1, y1).
- That's where z-buffers come in. Think of it like a topological projection of the figure onto a plane.
- We check our current pixel against the z-buffer, to check if it's the forward-most pixel for the gives x, y coordinate.
- Related to painter's algorithm.

### Texture mapping
 - Idk why it's called texture, I just did colors.
 - We have two files now: `.obj` and an image file that is the texture map for the object.
 - For each pixel in the model, we have a corresponding pixel in the texture image that tells us what the color of that pixel in the model should be.
 - Calculating this stuff was painful (I should revisit).
 
### Homogenous Coordinates
[Convo with chatgpt where it finally kinda clicked.](https://chat.openai.com/share/9979a3dc-13d1-43dc-bd5f-4fada2be6c48)

- Rotations, shears, scaling are linear tf so they won't move the origin.
- For translation, we _append_ another transformation after performing our lin tf.
- But this looks ugly and doesn't let us compose all transformations into a single matrix, so we need a way to represent non-lin tf as matrices.
- That's where homogeneous coordinates come in:
[representing translation using homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)#Matrix_representation)
- This means our 2D plane is the z = 1 plane inside a 3D space.
- So we do a linear transformation in 3D and then project the result back onto our 2D plane.
- Projecting 3D onto 2D is done by dividing the components by z.
- We embed 2D into 3D by putting it inside the plane z = 1.

- To project from 3D to 2D, we draw a straight line between the origin and the point to project and then we find its intersection with the plane z = 1.
- The intersection point is the projection of that point onto 2D.
- What about division by zero?
  - The projection basically projects (x, y, z) in the direction of (x, y) but onto z = 1. If the z is very small, the point basically gets projected in the direction of (x, y), but intersects z = 1 at a point infinitely far away.
  - So the thing is basically a vector pointing in (x, y).

### ModelView matrix
- This matrix is used to transform vertices of 3D objects into the camera's view space.
- Multiplying a vertex with this matrix will bring it into view as seen from the perspective from the specified "eye" position.
- This is cuz the renderer itself has no concept of camera. But we can _simulate_ one by transforming the scene in the opposite direction giving the illusion that the scene is being view from a different point.
- The matrix is an inverse matrix (Minv) cuz the transformation is gonna transform the "scene in the opposite direction".

- Read up on change of basis. We can figure out a formula for calculating (x', y', z') of the object w.r.t the alternate basis.

### Shaders
The part that calculates lighting, color and stuff for a scene.

**Vertex shader:**
- Transfroms scene using ModelView and other matrices.
- Calculates the varying values (`varying_intensity`) at  each vertex.
**Fragment shader:**
- Calculates color and lighting conditions for each pixel by extrapolating from the varying values.

- Data returned from the fragment shader is passed into the rasterizer which actually sets the color of the pixel.
