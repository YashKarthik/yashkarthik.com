I remember when 2022 started and I had a list of things I wanted to learn. Looking back I can see that I made some progress but also fell short in a few areas. In 2023 I want to be more specific and focused in my learning goals (also, I'm announcing them publicly so I feel more accountable).

So what _am_ I gonna learnt?

# Ethereum Stack
I have a decent understanding of the different parts of Ethereum development–Solidity, JS libraries etc–but never built a full-fledged project that covers the entire stack. This year, I'm planning to do [Speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) to understand building Dapps.

## Solidity
It's JS-like syntax is deceptive and now I know there's a lot for me to learn. I'm gonna dive into this by building Dapps and doing Solidity CTFs. I really enjoyed OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges and looking for more.

# Non-crypto Software
## Languages
I started with Scratch, then Python and now almost every project I build is in Typescript. I love TS, but... I feel like learning a new language. I'm split between Go and Rust. I'm probably gonna start with Go and delve into lower level languages later on when I'm exploring hardware projects.

## Miscellaneous
- I really need to understand auth. Theo's video on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wBYWWdyYQ) is really good, but I never got around to implementing it in my apps.
- AI seems to be the rage right now. While I'm not diving _deep_ into it, I'll probably build more SaaS-like projects that use AI apis. Recently: [Skimmr](https://skimmr.xyz).

# Hardware
I've explored hardware in the past, that's how I got into coding/tech, but haven't done much since the pandemic hit. Last summer I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and built an automated door handle for my room with it. And recently I won an [Orpheus Leep](https://leap-site.hackclub.dev/)(similar to Arduino) in the [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com/) hackathon. Haven't done much research into this space, but I think I'll start from the basics with C and Orpheus Leep and see where it takes me.

# Writing
I discovered my interest in writing after writing a Twitter thread.

This year, I plan to write more code-explanations and "How it Works" of open-source apps, particularly crypto protocols. I want to continue writing about my other interests and learnings from them. I'm also interested in trying out short stories.

### Checklist:
- [x] **Solidity**. No one's every _done_ learning a language. But for the sake of accountability, I'll consider
  this task "done", when I'm as comfortable with sol as am with TS and can go into a task and figure
  it out without too much googling. I'm planning to accomplish this by doing CTFs (Ethernaut, Damn
  Vulnerabl Defi etc), participating it audit contests and building my own apps.
- [ ] **Ethereum internals**. This one and the one above are quite intertwined. I think this is
essentially level 2 of learning solidity. I'm planning on reading the [Ethereum Book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
and the Yellow Paper to get started. Next, I gonna learn Yul (assembly) and write my own
implemantation of the OpenZeppelin library using this, then maybe learn [Huff lang](https://huff.sh/).
I also found this course [Learn EVM](https://learnevm.com/) which seems interesting.
- [ ] Go, AI-powered apps and other miscellaneous: learn by building cool stuff?

Feels good declaring all this publicly. I'm excited to see where 2023 takes me.
