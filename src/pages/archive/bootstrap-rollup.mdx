Bootstrapping a rollup remains an unsolved problem. It's similar to the early days of dapps. Anyone could clone Uniswap and offer 10*x* the yield. Most dapps resorted to some sort of tokenization (ICOs, air drops) to incentivize users to use their dapp long enough to form a [community-moat](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1446150773251977216 "twitter")  around it.

Rollups too could launch their own token, see Coindesk's [article](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/02/what-tokenization-could-do-for-ethereum-scaling-solutions/) on this. Another way to get more users onto your platform would be subsidizing the first *x* transactions.

# Subsidizing Transactions

A rollup's smaller user base means that each user has to pay a large fraction of the fees, increasing the cost per tx, and chasing away existing users. With a larger user base the gas will be split between more users and each user would pay a smaller fraction of the fees â‡’ lower cost per tx.

A rollup that offers free transactions for (say) 10 days after its launch will attract a large user base at the start, essentially eliminating the bootstrap phase.. With a large user base, even after stopping the subsidies, each user would have to pay a small fraction of the fee. Rollups achieve a sort of *economies of scale* when more people use them. Cost of each transaction falls when there are more transactions.

## Potential Downsides

An obvious flaw: projects with large funding can extend this free transaction phase longer, and outlast competition. I'll be updating this list as I come across other ways to *game* the market.
