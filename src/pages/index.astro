      <p>Right now, I'm:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>Learning PCB design and trying to fabricate my own board.</li>
        <li>Writing code at Helicone.</li>

        <li>Shipped semi-viral web apps built using ai apis.</li>
        <li>Written firmware for drones.</li>
        <li>Run linux on lego ev3.</li>
      </ul> <br/>

      <p>Some lore:</p>
      <p class="p-5">
        <i>Five years ago I awoke in a strange new world: I learned to code. <br/><br/>
        My friend and I were tasked with cleaning-up the robotics lab after a late night session.
        Rather than spending hours sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us
        (finishing the task in a few days instead of hours xD).
        
        I knew how transformative technology is. It had been all around us. But actually leveraging
        it myself to automate a mundane task was when I truly <b>grokked</b> the power of technology.
        
        Since then, I've built fast and beautiful web apps; efficient and powerful robots; slow and
        pointless(?) VMs; and learned to embrace the lightness of being a <b>perpetual
        beginner</b>.</i>
